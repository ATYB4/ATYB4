Hi! I'm Aryan, a young and dynamic full-stack developer.

I build versatile, fluid web apps and websites using the latest web technologies, exercising complete control over the content and display.

My skills are:
* HTML5
* CSS 3
* Semantics, Grid and Flexbox
* Responsive and fluid design
* Git, GitHub, Netlify and Vercel
* WordPress, Wix and Webflow

I had a 10-month work placement with the Sage Foundation as a front-end developer with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and as a back-end developer with Git CLI, Python, and the Heroku platform.
