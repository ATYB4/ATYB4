# How I Built My Site

I built my site using [React](https://reactjs.org), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, because of its convenient componentization and massive ecosystem.

I used React in conjunction with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a React framework, as it provides code splitting and server-side rendering for React components, improving user experience and search engine optimisation (SEO). Next.js also supports client-side routing, which makes page transitions faster.
